# 🏛️ The Deep Dive

### **The $6.2 Million Trash Gamble**
The Financial Management Board is deep into a feasibility study on whether Mt. Lebanon should ditch its contracted trash hauler (Republic Services) and run collection in-house. The current contract costs $4-4.5 million annually and expires in a couple of years. The board's preliminary estimate for going solo? **$6.2 million per year** — and that's *before* factoring in the cost of buying or leasing a facility to store trucks, or the $2 million price tag for a 7-truck fleet (3 automated side loaders at $420K-$450K each, 4 rear loaders at $300K-$400K). Add in $500K-$600K in annual fuel costs, $900K in tipping fees, and the reality that one sick employee or broken truck could shut down the entire operation, and the board is starting to wonder if this is even "close" to feasible. They're planning to interview Swiss Vale's DPW director (that township recently went in-house) and will report findings to the Commission in Q1 2026. **Why you care:** If this moves forward, your trash bill could spike — or the municipality could decide the risk isn't worth it and stick with Republic.

### **434 Washington Road: Neighbors Pump the Brakes**
A developer wants to split a 1.9-acre lot at 434 Washington Road into two parcels: one for two multi-family buildings (requiring 96 parking spaces but proposing only 76), the other for four 21-foot-wide townhouses. The Planning Board tabled all three motions — subdivision, land development, and a conditional use request for alternative parking — after hearing concerns from neighbors. Bill Bannow (460 Washington Road) criticized the developer for zero outreach to adjacent properties and argued the design was unimaginative. Tim Rogers (10 Oak Way) raised safety red flags about a proposed road access near his home, citing a prior study that said the road couldn't safely handle both entrance and exit traffic. The board wants architectural renderings, revised stormwater plans, and answers on parking before moving forward. **Why you care:** This is a by-right development in R-7 zoning, meaning the township can't block it outright — but the devil is in the details. If parking spills onto Washington Road or traffic stacks up at Oak Way, it's your problem.

### **Leaf Blower Ban Gets a Hearing**
Sean Ganoe from Navahoe Drive emailed the Resiliency Board asking Mt. Lebanon to ban gas-powered leaf blowers. The Sustainability + Local Ecology Committee acknowledged the request but said it needs more research, including impacts on local landscaping businesses and neighboring communities. The board is also exploring a separate Lebo Green initiative to ban single-use plastics and Styrofoam. **Why you care:** If you're a weekend warrior with a gas blower, or if you hire a lawn crew, this could affect you. The board didn't take a vote yet, but the fact they're "exploring" it means it's not dead on arrival.

# 🕵️‍♂️ The Smoke Detector

### **Zoning & Development Watch: 434 Washington Road**
The Planning Board tabled three motions for a multi-family/townhouse development at 434 Washington Road after neighbors raised safety and parking concerns. The developer is seeking a conditional use permit to reduce required parking from 96 spaces to 76, claiming credits for on-street parking and transit access. The board wants architectural elevations, revised stormwater plans, and answers on traffic flow before moving forward. **Street name:** 434 Washington Road, with proposed access at Oak Way. **Why it matters:** This is a by-right R-7 project, so the township can't kill it — but they can make the developer sweat the details. If parking spills onto Washington Road or traffic backs up at Oak Way, it's your commute.

### **Spending Watch: Trash Study Could Cost More Than Current Contract**
The Financial Management Board is studying whether to bring trash collection in-house. Preliminary estimates show **$6.2 million annually** in employee costs alone (before equipment, facilities, or fuel), compared to the current $4-4.5 million contract with Republic Services. The board is also eyeing a **$2 million fleet** (7 trucks) and $500K-$600K in annual fuel costs. No consultant has been hired yet, but if the board decides this is feasible, expect a recommendation to the Commission in Q1 2026. **Why it matters:** This could mean higher trash fees — or a decision to stick with the status quo.

# 📉 The Disconnect Index
⚠️ **The Room vs. The Board:** 2 residents spoke against the 434 Washington Road development (Bill Bannow and Tim Rogers), raising concerns about communication, safety, and parking. The Planning Board voted unanimously to **table** all three motions (subdivision, land development, and conditional use for parking), effectively delaying the project rather than approving or denying it. While the board didn't vote *against* the residents, tabling means the developer gets another chance to address concerns — so the outcome is still TBD. **100% of speakers** were critical of the project as currently proposed.
