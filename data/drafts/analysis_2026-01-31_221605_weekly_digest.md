# 🏛️ The Deep Dive

## Should Mt. Lebanon Ban Gas Leaf Blowers?

A Baywood Avenue resident presented the Resiliency Board with a roadmap: Lower Merion Township (outside Philadelphia) became Pennsylvania's first municipality to restrict gas-powered leaf blowers in November 2025, with a phased ban ending in a complete prohibition by 2029. The ordinance allows electric blowers year-round and exempts snow events, applies to residents and landscapers alike, and enforces complaints with fines starting at $100. The resident noted equipment costs are low—a corded Ryobi model plus extension cord runs about $100 on Amazon—and offered informal assistance if the Board pursues it.

**Why it matters:** If Mt. Lebanon follows suit, landscaping companies (and homeowners) would need to switch equipment. The Board didn't vote or commit, but the fact they're hearing this now—combined with the detailed ordinance framework—suggests it's on their radar for 2026. Commissioner Sigler acknowledged the presentation but didn't signal next steps.

## Municipally-Run Trash: The $6.2M Question

The Financial Management Board spent its January meeting dissecting whether Mt. Lebanon should operate its own trash collection when the current contract expires in a couple years. Staff estimates came in at **$6.2 million annually**—roughly 50% higher than the current $4-4.5 million contract. The breakdown: $2 million for seven trucks (likely leased), over $500,000/year in fuel (escalating to $600k over eight years), $900,000 in tipping fees, and $6.2 million in employee costs (including benefits, workers' comp, and PPE). Real estate is another headache: the municipality would need property for truck storage and washing (with environmental compliance for water runoff), but any discrete property search risks tipping off the press and inflating prices.

**The pivot:** After realizing in-house operations won't pencil out, the Board shifted focus to **regional cooperation**—potentially partnering with Upper St. Clair or other South Hills communities to share executive costs and achieve scale. The challenge? Different collection schedules between towns. The Board will meet with Swissville (which recently went in-house) and refine cost models before drafting a feasibility report next quarter. One member noted bluntly: "If I call anyone about real estate, it's going to be in the paper."

**Why it matters:** If the Board recommends against municipally-run service, residents will continue under a private contract (likely with price increases). If they pursue a regional cooperative, you might see new collection days or shared equipment. Either way, this decision affects every household's weekly routine—and tax bill.

## Library's Two-Tier Card Dilemma: Access vs. Affordability

The Library Board is wrestling with a policy question that pits mission against money: Should Mt. Lebanon restrict expensive e-resources (like Canopy streaming video and Hoopla Flex) to residents only, or continue offering them to anyone in Allegheny County who gets a library card? The trigger: Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh may discontinue county-wide Hoopla service, and Mt. Lebanon's e-resource costs are climbing 22-23% annually. Canopy operates on a pay-per-user model with tiered pricing—more users push the library into higher cost brackets, and staff identified "super users" from as far as Peters Township (a different county).

**The debate:** Board members opposed to a two-tier system argued it conflicts with the library's "book sanctuary" image and opens the door to charging fees for other services. Supporters countered that Mt. Lebanon taxpayers fund the library at a high level, and other municipalities could choose to invest similarly. One member framed it starkly: "If it comes down to we are either going to lose these services or we're going to have to do this, I would vote to do it."

**Next steps:** Staff will present detailed usage data at the February meeting, showing exactly how many non-residents use these services and what the actual costs are. The Governance Committee will review, with a target decision window of **May-July 2026** to align with other policy updates. Director Robin noted: "I personally I'm not sure myself which way I would go. I don't like the idea of reducing the services...I also came up through large inner city libraries where I have a hard time saying these people can have these special things that these people can't."

**Why it matters:** If the Board implements a two-tier system, non-Mt. Lebanon residents would lose access to premium streaming and enhanced e-book services (though basic Allegheny County offerings would remain). If they don't, the library may need to cut these services entirely to control costs—affecting Mt. Lebanon residents who rely on them.

## School Board Vacancy: Six Candidates, Six Philosophies

The School Board interviewed six candidates to fill the seat vacated by Mr. Wyland's resignation. Here's the snapshot:

- **Arian Ban** (parent of three, including a child with autism): Emphasized "unique lived experience" through IEPs and GIEPs, focused on strengthening special education and fiscal responsibility. Active PTA coordinator and Scouts board member.

- **Clemens Wagan** (attorney): Brought contract negotiation expertise and "the right kind of temperament" in polarized times. Ran unsuccessfully in the most recent election. Co-chairs a professionals-with-disabilities group and advocates for LGBTQ issues. Attended planning meetings for the district's long-term plan.

- **Rev. Dr. Strauss** (pastor): Doctorate in Ministry with focus on neighborhood engagement. Co-chairs Bread for the World (hunger advocacy). Promised a "non-anxious presence" and lobbied in Harrisburg and DC on childhood hunger programs. Would "love to consider pursuing a full term."

- **Miss Salone** (professor/entrepreneur): MBA and MFA, teaches "Argument and Research" at Robert Morris. Ran a startup adapting picture books for touchscreens. Treasurer of Little Lake Theater, Reflections chair for Markham PTA. "I love numbers and spreadsheets. And I love the arts and literature as well."

- **Mr. Lorac** (financial advisor): Mt. Lebanon graduate, small business owner, Children's Museum board member for 20 years. Youth basketball coach. Praised current leadership but challenged the strategic planning process: "When do we get to talk about some of the more negative things?" Wants Mt. Lebanon to be "the best district in Western Pennsylvania."

- **Mr. King** (business professional): Led $50M portfolio and national team. Treasurer of Mt. Lebanon Partnership, Parks & Rec Board member. Attends "eight out of 10" school board meetings. Emphasized "diversity and representation" and "checks and balances." Flagged budget sustainability, structural deficits, and substitute teacher shortages as challenges.

**The vote:** Scheduled for **February 9, 2026** at the public meeting. Candidates will hear from the district office that day.

**Why it matters:** This appointment shapes the Board's direction for the remainder of the term. The candidates ranged from fiscal hawks to equity advocates, from insiders (Mt. Lebanon grads) to newcomers (20-year residents who "chose Pittsburgh"). Watch for how the Board balances experience, diversity, and temperament in their decision.

# 🕵️‍♂️ The Smoke Detector

## Zoning Refresh: The Year-Long Process Begins

The Commission is launching a **complete overhaul** of Mt. Lebanon's zoning code and Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance (SALDO), targeting a **Spring 2027 completion**. A steering committee meeting is set for **February 6** to hash out outreach to the Resiliency Board, Partnership, and other stakeholder groups. The consultants (OM and subs) are aware of these groups and expect the Resiliency Board to have "significant input" given their expertise.

**Why this matters:** Zoning changes dictate what can be built where—height limits, setbacks, mixed-use allowances, ADUs (accessory dwelling units). A 24-year-old resident at the January 27 Commission meeting specifically requested "more deregulation of housing market and development" to help young families afford Mt. Lebanon, suggesting mixed-use developments and public funding support. President Seagler acknowledged the Commission is "going through zoning refresh and will consider these issues." Watch for debates over density, parking requirements, and whether commercial corridors (like Washington Road) allow residential above storefronts.

## Snow Pyramid Protest: Disabled Veteran vs. Public Works

A Cage Avenue resident confronted the Commission about a **5-foot-tall snow pyramid** public works crews created on his corner lot during plowing operations. He noted an unused sidewalk across the street where snow could have been placed instead. As a disabled veteran, he stated he will **not remove the snow** and challenged the township to "issue me a ticket." President Seagler acknowledged it's "a complicated issue" and promised a more in-depth answer—but no timeline or resolution was announced.

**Why it matters:** This highlights the tension between efficient snow removal (plows push snow to corners) and property owner burden. If the township tickets him, it could spark broader debate about where snow gets dumped and whether disabled/elderly residents get accommodations.

## Private Street Plowing: Why Smith Lane Gets Ignored

Two Summer Place residents requested plowing and salting for **Smith Lane**, a private road serving five residents that's been in existence since 1910. They noted the November Mt. Lebanon magazine stated the municipality plows **37 private streets**, and pointed out the township plows a *shorter* private driveway off Lindendale with only three residents. The township called Smith Lane a "driveway," but residents argue it's used by school students and adults as a walkway from Summer Place to Cedar Boulevard. President Seagler acknowledged it's "complicated" but gave no timeline for a decision.

**Why it matters:** If the township adds Smith Lane to the plowing list, it could open the door for other private roads to request service—potentially increasing snow removal costs and setting a precedent for what qualifies as a "street" vs. a "driveway."

## School Board Candidate Signals: Who's the "Check and Balance"?

One candidate (Mr. King) framed his candidacy explicitly as providing "diversity and representation" for "about half the town" and called himself a "critical check and balance" that's "missing today on the school board respectfully." He attends "eight out of 10" school board meetings and flagged budget sustainability, structural deficits, and substitute teacher shortages as top challenges. Another candidate (Mr. Lorac) praised the current Board for finding "a great leader" (Superintendent Dr. Freeze) but noted "the district had become stale" under previous leadership.

**Why it matters:** The framing reveals a potential ideological split. King's "checks and balances" language suggests he sees the current Board as too homogenous or insufficiently fiscally conservative. Lorac's "stale" comment implies he values the Board's recent direction but wants to push further. Watch the **February 9 vote** to see whether the Board selects a consensus-builder or a contrarian.
