# 🚨 The Headlines

- **In-House Trash Collection Could Cost $6.2M+ Annually — Nearly 50% More Than Current Contract.** The Financial Management Board is studying whether Mt. Lebanon should ditch its private hauler and run collection in-house. Early numbers show operating costs alone would hit $6.2 million per year, compared to the current $4-4.5 million contract — before buying trucks, building a facility, or accounting for equipment failures that could shut down the entire operation.

- **Library Board Debates Restricting e-Resources to Mt. Lebanon Residents Only.** The board is considering a two-tier card system that would lock expensive digital resources (Canopy, Hoopla Flex, databases) behind a Mt. Lebanon residency wall to control costs. Multiple board members expressed discomfort with the move, calling it exclusionary — but the financial pressure is real if Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh drops county-wide funding.

- **$1.7M in Sewer Projects Approved; Robinson Pipe Cleaning Lands Three Renewal Contracts Totaling $458,588.** The Commission greenlit sewer lining, cleaning, and manhole rehabilitation contracts for 2026, with Robinson Pipe Cleaning Company winning all three renewal deals — a cumulative $458,588 in recurring work.

# 🏛️ The Deep Dive

## **In-House Trash Collection: $6.2M Annual Operating Cost vs. $4.5M Current Contract**

**The Numbers:** The Financial Management Board's preliminary feasibility study estimates in-house trash collection would cost **$6.2 million annually** in operating expenses alone — a **38% increase** over the current contracted rate of $4-4.5 million. This does not include capital costs (trucks, facility, equipment) or the risk buffer needed for redundancy.

**The Hidden Detail:** The board admitted a critical vulnerability: **"One employee call-out or one truck breakdown could shut down the entire operation."** Unlike legacy haulers (Republic Services, Waste Management) who can swap trucks and personnel across multiple municipalities, Mt. Lebanon would have zero backup. The board estimated needing **7 trucks** to run 3-5 routes daily, but would likely need to lease or purchase **8-9 trucks** to account for maintenance rotations and sick days — similar to how police departments buy more cruisers than they deploy. This redundancy cost is embedded in the $6.2M estimate but was flagged as a structural weakness.

Additionally, **tipping fees alone run $900,000 annually**, and the board acknowledged that current invoices don't itemize tonnage — making it hard to negotiate better rates as a one-off municipality. Legacy haulers own some disposal sites (vertical integration), giving them pricing leverage Mt. Lebanon won't have.

**The "Next Step" Prediction:** The board is interviewing Swiss Vale's DPW director (who recently went in-house) to validate assumptions and stress-test the $6.2M estimate. Unless that conversation reveals hidden savings or operational tricks, expect the Commission to conclude in Q1 2026 that in-house collection is **not financially feasible** and renew the private contract when it expires in a couple of years. The board's tone was analytical, not advocacy — they're trying to answer "Can we do this?" not "Should we do this?"

## **Library's Two-Tier Card System: A Clash Between Fiscal Reality and Mission**

**The Numbers:** Mt. Lebanon currently funds **9 e-resources** (Canopy, Hoopla Flex, America's Newspapers, Culture Grams, etc.) available to **anyone in Allegheny County** who holds an Mt. Lebanon library card. Canopy uses tiered pricing based on usage — more users = higher costs. The library is concerned that if Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh discontinues county-wide Hoopla Flex funding (a real possibility), Mt. Lebanon's costs will spike and become unsustainable.

**The Hidden Detail:** The board's discomfort with the proposal is genuine and philosophical, not procedural. Director Robyn Vittek stated: *"I came up through large inner city libraries where I have a hard time saying these people can have these special things that these people can't."* One board member said: *"We're a book sanctuary, but sorry you can't use these."* Another warned: *"Once that door gets kicked in, man, does it start getting way easier to start saying now we charge for this and this and this."* 

The board is not split on facts — they're split on **values**. They acknowledge the financial squeeze is real but fear the optics of exclusivity and the slippery slope of fees.

**The "Next Step" Prediction:** The board tabled a formal decision and asked staff (Sharon Binsky) to return in February with **detailed usage data, cost breakdowns, and a count of in-county vs. out-of-county cardholders**. An alternative is being explored: charging a modest annual fee ($4-5, similar to Ohio public libraries) for out-of-county residents rather than a hard restriction. Expect a policy vote by **May-July 2026**, likely landing on a hybrid approach (fee for non-residents, Mt. Lebanon residents get full access) rather than a complete two-tier system. The board's tone suggests they will not approve blanket exclusivity.

## **Library Renovation and Bond Issue Timeline: 9-10 Month Project Pending Keystone Grant Decision**

**The Numbers:** The library is planning a **9-10 month renovation** for the first phase. The Keystone Grant (up to $750,000, with required municipal match) decision is expected in **March 2026**. If approved, the municipality has an **18-month window (April 1 - September 30)** to complete the work.

**The Hidden Detail:** Director Vittek told the board: *"I'm assuming we'll get some of it because we are redoing our bathrooms and making some ADA improvements and they really look at that."* This is not a guarantee — it's an educated guess based on the grant's priorities. The library may need to close for some days or relocate operations during construction, but the goal is to "stay open as much as possible."

**The "Next Step" Prediction:** The library's bond issue projects (renovation, tech upgrades) are pending Commission approval of a bond issuance. No timeline has been set. Expect the Commission to vote on bond scope and amount in Q1 or Q2 2026, with renovation work potentially starting in spring 2026 if the Keystone Grant comes through.

## **Sewer Contracts Renewed; Robinson Pipe Cleaning Company Wins All Three Bids**

**The Numbers:** The Commission approved **$1,124,196** for 2026 sewer lining (Insight Pipe Contracting LLC), **$400,150** for sewer cleaning/televising renewal, and **$58,438.45** for manhole rehabilitation — all with Robinson Pipe Cleaning Company. Robinson now holds **three consecutive renewal contracts** with the municipality, totaling **$458,588 in 2026 alone**.

**The Hidden Detail:** Robinson Pipe Cleaning Company was the winning vendor on **both cleaning and manhole rehab renewals** without competitive bid language mentioned in the Commission meeting. This is a repeat vendor pattern: the company has been performing these services for multiple years and the Commission simply renewed. No alternative bids were discussed or presented.

**The "Next Step" Prediction:** These are routine renewals with no controversy flagged. Expect Robinson to continue as the primary sewer maintenance contractor for 2027 and beyond unless performance issues arise.

## **School Board Candidate Interviews: Three Finalists for One Vacant Seat**

**The Numbers:** The School Board interviewed **3 candidates** for **1 vacant board position** (replacing Mr. Wyland). Each candidate answered 8 predetermined questions in a 10-minute timeframe.

**The Hidden Detail:** The candidates represent diverse backgrounds: Arian Ban (parent with a daughter on the autism spectrum), a lawyer trained in conflict resolution, and Rev. Dr. Strauss (social justice focus, menstrual hygiene advocacy). No candidate emerged as a clear frontrunner from the transcript — all gave substantive answers without major gaffes or standout moments. The board asked probing questions but did not indicate a preference.

**The "Next Step" Prediction:** The board will deliberate and vote during the **public meeting on Monday, February 9, 2026**. Expect the decision to be announced immediately after the vote. Given the diversity of the candidate pool, the board is likely seeking someone who brings a perspective the current board lacks — whether that's special education advocacy, legal/conflict resolution skills, or social justice focus remains unclear.

## **Rockwood Park Playground Renovation: Removing Unsafe Swing Set, Adding Inclusive Play Elements**

**The Numbers:** The Commission approved **$84,412.90** for playground surface installation at Rockwood Park (Vendor: Yoka Playgrounds). The project includes fall zone surface replacement, ADA-accessible turf, and inclusive play elements.

**The Hidden Detail:** Parks Coordinator Phil Avolio stated: *"I also don't love that it's right where you're asking cars to pull in and stop... the reason it's coming out is because it does not meet safety requirements."* This refers to a small swing set being removed due to current playground safety codes — not due to wear or unpopularity, but because the inclined fall surface no longer complies with regulations. The new design will address this by repositioning equipment and upgrading surfaces.

**The "Next Step" Prediction:** The project is in the design/permitting phase. Expect construction to begin in spring 2026 once weather permits and final permits are in place.

# 🕵️‍♂️ The Smoke Detector

⚠️ **The "Wait, What?" Financials — In-House Trash Collection Cost Delta:** The Financial Management Board's preliminary estimate shows in-house trash collection would cost **$6.2 million annually in operating expenses alone**, compared to the current **$4-4.5 million contract** — a **38-57% cost increase**. This does not include capital equipment, facility costs, or the hidden redundancy buffer needed to prevent single-point-of-failure shutdowns. The board flagged that one truck breakdown or employee absence could halt the entire operation, unlike private haulers who have fleet backup. Current contract expires in a couple of years; expect the Commission to renew with the private vendor unless Swiss Vale's in-house experience reveals game-changing savings.

⚠️ **Legal/Liability Threat — Library Lending Policy Controversy:** The Library Board's proposal to restrict e-resources (Canopy, Hoopla Flex) to Mt. Lebanon residents only is generating internal board conflict over equity and optics. Multiple board members expressed discomfort with exclusivity, and the Governance Committee flagged the topic as "controversial" — rare for a policy discussion. Director Vittek's statement about struggling with the concept ("I came up through large inner city libraries where I have a hard time saying these people can have these special things that these people can't") signals potential pushback from staff if the board votes for restriction. Expect this to surface in public comment if the board advances a two-tier system.

⚠️ **Zoning & Development Watch — Hidden Hollow Golf Course Concept:** The Resiliency Board noted that a "Hidden Hollow Concept" presentation is scheduled for the Parks Advisory Board in February. No details were provided in this week's notes, but this signals a potential master plan or redesign for the Hidden Hollow golf course property. Watch for details on whether this involves course closure, conversion to public parkland, residential development, or other use changes.

⚠️ **Repeat Vendor Alert — Robinson Pipe Cleaning Company:** Robinson Pipe Cleaning Company was awarded **three renewal contracts** totaling **$458,588 in 2026** (sewer cleaning, manhole rehabilitation, and point repair). This is the third consecutive year of renewals with no competitive bid discussion mentioned. Cumulative spending with this vendor over the past 3 years likely exceeds $1.3 million. Monitor whether the Commission plans to re-bid these services or if Robinson is locked into a multi-year agreement.

⚠️ **Quiet No — Gasoline Leaf Blower Restrictions:** John Herman (Baywood Avenue resident) advocated during the Resiliency Board meeting for restrictions on gasoline leaf blowers, citing Lower Merion Township's recent ban. The board's "Sustainability and Local Ecology Committee" has proposed bans on plastic bags, styrofoam, and gas-powered leaf blowers, but the discussion was **tabled until next month due to a key member's absence**. No follow-up date or commitment was made. This is a classic bureaucratic pocket veto — the request was heard, but no timeline for action was promised. If residents want to push this, expect to see it resurface in February or March.

# 📉 The Disconnect Index

**No significant disconnects detected this week.** Public comment at the Commission meeting included requests for municipal snow removal on private roads (Smith Lane) and housing deregulation — neither of which were voted on or formally addressed by the Commission. The Library Board's lending policy discussion did not include formal public comment (board members only), so no room-vs.-vote comparison is possible. The Resiliency Board's leaf blower discussion was tabled with no vote, so no disconnect exists. All other votes this week were unanimous routine approvals with no public opposition.
