# 🏛️ The Deep Dive

## **The $225 vs. $300+ Trash Math — Why Mt. Lebanon Pays a Premium**

**The Gap:** Swissvale charges neighboring municipalities $225 per household for trash collection. Mt. Lebanon currently pays "in the threes" (over $300) to Republic Services — and Waste Management quoted $450 per household when the contract was last bid.

**The Hidden Detail:** Financial Management Board members visited Swissvale's operation and discovered Mt. Lebanon routes are "low man on the totem pole" for private haulers. Tighter streets, alleys, and parked cars make our routes more labor-intensive — and less profitable. Swissvale's director admitted their $225 rate doesn't cover full costs; it's a political decision to keep rates low for partner communities. Meanwhile, Latrobe just brought trash in-house (January 2026) after Republic demanded a 40% rate increase.

**The Next Step:** Staff will compile findings from Swissvale and Latrobe and report back "in the next couple months" on whether the Commission wants to hire a consultant for a full feasibility study. If the municipality moves forward, union contract negotiations would begin this year — two years before the current Republic contract expires in 2028. The board discussed leasing trucks for a 5-year trial period rather than buying upfront, and purchasing vacant land along the Route 79 corridor for a storage/maintenance facility.

## **School Board's 5-2 Split Over Vacant Seat — 12 Candidates, One Contentious Vote**

**The Numbers:** Dr. Laura Strauss won appointment to fill Jacob Wyland's vacant board seat with 5 votes. Ms. Anamaria Johnson received 2 votes from Directors Crrael and Hoffman. Twelve candidates interviewed; the board used a scoring rubric to narrow the field to three finalists (Strauss, Johnson, and Richard Lorac).

**The Hidden Detail:** One resident (Paula Bonjouro) testified during public comment that the board lacks diversity — specifically, representation for seniors (21.6% of the population), singles (39.9% of households), and non-parents. She advocated for Patrick King, citing his community involvement (Mount Lebanon Partnership treasurer, Parks Advisory Board member, youth sports coach) and professional expertise. The board did not explain why King was not among the top three scorers, and no discussion of the scoring rubric was held publicly.

**The Next Step:** Dr. Strauss was immediately sworn in by the board secretary and took her seat. A ceremonial re-swearing-in with a magistrate is scheduled for February 16, 2026, prior to the voting meeting, so family and friends can attend. The appointment fills the remainder of Wyland's term through 2022 (note: this appears to be a clerical error in the transcript; likely refers to the remainder of the current term).

## **The $12.1M Stadium Question — and Why the Track Gets Replaced at the Same Time**

**The Numbers:** The School District's 10-year capital plan includes a stadium facility replacement in 2028 — covering home grandstands, locker rooms, restrooms, and lights. Previous 2024 estimates ranged from $4.2 million (low end) to $12.1 million (high end). New estimates are needed. The project also includes a $2.2 million track replacement (done in 2020, 8-year warranty).

**The Hidden Detail:** The stadium boiler is at the end of its useful life — fed by salvaged parts from other schools over the years. But the real cost driver is timing: the track will be damaged during stadium renovation, so the district plans to replace it concurrently "to save mobilization costs" (i.e., avoid paying a contractor to return months later). The high school pool also needs refinishing ($2.2M budget line) — the Marsite finish is flaking after 13 years.

**The Next Step:** The district is building fund balance to 8%, then moving funds into capital reserves. Bonds come due in 2027; market conditions are currently unfavorable for refinancing. The board will discuss bonding strategy over the next two years. If the stadium project proceeds in 2028, expect a bond issue vote in 2027.

## **The Active Transportation Plan's "Street Typology" — What It Means for Your Block**

**The Numbers:** Mt. Lebanon and Dormont hired Tool Design to create a joint active transportation and safety action plan. The plan divides every street in both municipalities into five typologies: Passthrough (alleys/low-traffic), Suburban Residential (rolled curbs, buffered sidewalks), Urban Residential (traditional grid, limited driveways), Community Connectors (higher traffic, linking destinations), and Main Street Connectors (regional destinations, transit routes). Each typology gets different safety treatments — from daylighting (removing parking near intersections) to raised crosswalks to no-right-turn-on-red rules.

**The Hidden Detail:** The current school district policy prohibits biking to school — and has no accommodation for e-bikes or motorized scooters at the elementary level. The police department is conducting an analysis of crossing guard posts "in conjunction with the school district" to identify recommended walking routes (the old federal "safe walking routes" designation no longer exists). The plan will recommend changes to school transportation policies, but implementation depends on the school board.

**The Next Step:** A pop-up engagement event is scheduled for February 25, 2026, at Mt. Lebanon Library, Dormont Library, and East End Brewing Company. The full draft plan will be ready in March 2026, with final document completion in April 2026. Once adopted, the Mobility Board will review street typology designations and recommend treatments to the Commission. The goal: implement improvements during street repaving to avoid standalone projects.

## **The 77% Sidewalk Coverage Myth — and the 5,000 Slabs Mt. Lebanon Just Replaced**

**The Numbers:** 77% of municipal streets have sidewalks (at least one side). That's almost 120 miles of sidewalks. But the Root Damage Program (2019-2025) replaced almost 5,000 slabs in the last 5-6 years — each dot on the Public Works map represents one slab. The Assessment Program (where property owners are billed for deteriorated slabs) is not happening in 2026 — the municipality skipped it to avoid competing with the root damage program.

**The Hidden Detail:** The municipality takes financial responsibility for root-damaged slabs (tree roots lifting concrete). But deteriorated slabs (cracking, settling) are the property owner's responsibility — and the Commission must authorize the work. The Assessment Program was paused because the municipality wanted to finish the root damage program first, avoiding a situation where residents are billed for repairs while the municipality is also doing repairs on the same street. The 10-zone system (established 15-20 years ago) is currently working in zones 9 and 10.

**The Next Step:** The Assessment Program will resume after the root damage program is complete. The ADA Ramp Program (8-10 ramps per year, funded 50% by CDBG) continues. New ramps are installed as part of any street reconstruction (federal law requirement). The Sidewalk Expansion Project is moving to Greenhurst in 2026 (bid documents in progress, neighborhood meeting held January 2026) and Lakemont in 2027.

# 🏟️ Field & Facility Watch

**Middle Field and Clint Seymour Field:** Turf replacement proposed in 2026 bond issue (~$1.3M). Lighting improvements for Clint Seymour Field also included (~$1.8M). Cedar Boulevard parking lot expansion planned to serve southern end of turf fields.

**High School Stadium:** Boiler at end of life; grandstands, locker rooms, and restrooms need replacement by 2028. Previous estimates: $4.2M–$12.1M. Track replacement (done 2020) will be included to avoid double mobilization costs.

**High School Pool:** Marsite finish flaking after 13 years; refinishing budgeted in 2028 capital plan (~$2.2M total for pool and other projects).

**Jefferson Middle School:** Football, soccer, and softball field turfing proposed for 2029 (preliminary numbers obtained; more cost-effective than Mellon).

**High School Turf:** Resurfaced in 2025 at no cost due to issues; 10-year replacement projection (2035), 8-year warranty.

**Foster Elementary Tennis Courts:** Proposed resurface to tennis/pickleball in 2028 (courts in bad condition).

# 🕵️‍♂️ The Smoke Detector

⚠️ **The "Wait, What?" Financials:** Swissvale charges partner municipalities $225 per household for trash collection — but Mt. Lebanon pays "in the threes" (over $300) to Republic Services. Waste Management quoted $450 per household. The gap: Mt. Lebanon routes are "low man on the totem pole" for private haulers due to tighter streets and alleys. Swissvale's director admitted their $225 rate doesn't cover full costs — it's a political subsidy. Meanwhile, Latrobe brought trash in-house in January 2026 after Republic demanded a 40% rate increase.

⚠️ **The Quiet No:** One resident (Julie Anne Sullivan, 48 Shady Drive West) requested improved sidewalk snow clearing enforcement 15 days after a snowstorm — specifically citing rental properties as "biggest culprits" and requesting a part-time enforcement officer like parking enforcement. Commissioner Seagler responded that the municipality "did a tremendous job" and that the police department is the enforcement mechanism. No commitment to additional enforcement resources or a dedicated reporting site. The municipality issued warnings and "a few citations."

⚠️ **Zoning Fights:** John Reagan (777 Shady Drive East) delivered the sixth in a series critiquing Mt. Lebanon's zoning and development laws — this time targeting driveway regulations. Key issues: mandatory driveway construction for new homes or repaving; minimum driveway width (land development ordinance) is larger than maximum driveway width (streets/sidewalks code and zoning code); wider driveways allow cars to cross sidewalks at higher speeds (hostile to pedestrians); code bans modest parking pads without variance; any property with a garage in the past must perpetually maintain a garage; every house/townhouse requires off-street parking for two vehicles minimum. Commissioner Seagler acknowledged the zoning code has "inconsistencies" and is "outdated" — the first steering committee kickoff for a zoning refresh occurred last Friday with consultants.

⚠️ **Legal/Liability Threats:** The Commission held an executive session for "legal advice from solicitor on various topics" prior to the discussion session. No details disclosed.

# 📉 The Disconnect Index

⚠️ **The Room vs. The Board:** 1 resident (Paula Bonjouro) spoke in favor of Patrick King for the board vacancy, citing community involvement and professional expertise. The board did not explain why King was not among the top three finalists (Strauss, Johnson, Lorac) or provide details on the scoring rubric. Dr. Strauss was appointed 5-2. 100% of public speakers (1 person) supported a candidate who was not appointed.
