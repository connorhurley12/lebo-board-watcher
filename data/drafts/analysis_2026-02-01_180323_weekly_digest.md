# 🚨 The Headlines

- **Municipal Trash Service Could Cost Taxpayers $2M More Per Year** — The Finance Board's in-house collection study reveals $6.2M in annual labor costs alone, compared to the current $4-4.5M contract. Equipment and facilities would add millions more.

- **Washington Road Development Tabled After Neighbors Blast "Zero Communication"** — The 434 Washington Road project (6 multifamily units + 4 townhomes) was tabled on all three motions after residents complained developers never contacted adjacent properties about traffic and parking impacts.

- **New Property Maintenance Code Could Hit Every Homeowner** — Ordinance 2-26 introduces landscaping, sidewalk, and window standards across all Mt. Lebanon properties, with enforcement mechanisms to "prevent blight."

# 🏛️ The Deep Dive

## Municipal Trash Collection: The $2M Question

**The Numbers:** The Financial Management Board's in-house trash study reveals a brutal gap: $6.2 million in annual employee costs alone, versus the current $4-4.5 million private contract. That's before adding $2 million in trucks, facility costs, and $900,000 in annual tipping fees.

**The Hidden Detail:** Board member Marty Basik admitted the operation has "no scale advantage" — one sick employee or one broken truck could shut down the entire system, unlike legacy haulers who can substitute from their regional fleet. The Board also discovered they can't even gather competitive intelligence without tipping off the public, since engaging a real estate broker would require confidentiality agreements. Finance Director McCreery noted the irony: "Legacy haulers may get better rates than one-off municipalities" because some *own the disposal sites* (vertical integration).

**The "Next Step" Prediction:** Given the $2M+ annual gap and operational fragility, expect the Board to recommend renewing the private contract when it expires in "a couple of years." The Swiss Vale interview (a neighboring municipality that recently went in-house) will likely confirm these concerns rather than solve them. This study is heading toward a "not feasible" conclusion by Q1 2026.

## 434 Washington Road: Developer vs. Neighbors on Parking and Traffic

**The Numbers:** The developer proposes 76 parking spaces where zoning requires 96 — a 20-space shortfall they're trying to cover with an "Alternative Parking Plan" that counts on-street spaces and transit access. The project would subdivide a 1.9-acre lot into two parcels: one with two multifamily buildings (1.7 acres), the other with four 21-foot-wide townhouses (0.2 acres).

**The Hidden Detail:** Resident Bill Bannow (460 Washington Road) told the Planning Board the developers did "zero communication" with neighboring properties before filing. Tim Rogers (10 Oak Way) raised safety concerns about the proposed road access near his property, citing "previous studies" that showed the road "could not safely accommodate both entrance and exit traffic." The Board responded by tabling all three motions — subdivision plan, land development plan, and conditional use for parking — but framed it as giving the developer time to address "Engineer's Review letter comments," not resident opposition.

**The "Next Step" Prediction:** Expect revised plans at the August 2025 meeting (next scheduled Planning Board session). The developer will likely add architectural renderings, adjust the parking layout, and *maybe* reduce the townhouse count — but don't expect them to abandon the Alternative Parking Plan. The Board's tone suggested they're open to the project's density; they just want better documentation.

## Property Maintenance Ordinance: New Rules for Every Yard

**The Numbers:** Ordinance 2-26 applies to *all properties* in Mt. Lebanon — not just commercial or problem properties. The code adds enforceable standards for landscaping, sidewalks, driveways, windows, and glazing.

**The Hidden Detail:** This isn't about abandoned houses. The ordinance's stated goal is to "maintain property values" and "prevent blight" — language that suggests the Municipality wants enforcement tools *before* a property becomes an eyesore. Commissioner Izzo introduced the bill, and a public hearing is scheduled for January 27, 2026, but no details were provided about what triggers a violation or what the penalties are.

**The "Next Step" Prediction:** Expect pushback at the January 27 public hearing from residents worried about subjective enforcement (e.g., "What counts as adequate landscaping?"). The ordinance will likely pass — it's framed as preventive maintenance, not a crackdown — but watch for amendments that clarify thresholds or add a warning system before fines kick in.

# 🕵️‍♂️ The Smoke Detector

⚠️ **The "Wait, What?" Financials:** The in-house trash study reveals workers' compensation is "quite expensive" (40% overhead *before* adding workers comp), and the Board admitted current invoices from Republic don't itemize tonnage costs — meaning they can't verify if they're getting competitive rates. Subcommittee member Kevin Repcheck noted, "Legacy haulers may get better rates than one-off municipalities."

⚠️ **Legal/Liability Threats:** The Commission met in executive session on January 13 to "receive legal advice from solicitor on various topics" — no details disclosed. This preceded the introduction of the property maintenance ordinance, suggesting potential enforcement or liability concerns.

⚠️ **The "Quiet No":** Resiliency Board member Sean Ganoe emailed about banning gas-powered leaf blowers, and the Board responded with "both requests [leaf blowers and single-use plastics] need further research" — no timeline, no committee assignment, no follow-up promised. Translation: dead on arrival.

⚠️ **Zoning Fights:** The 434 Washington Road project is a by-right development under R-7 zoning, meaning the Board can't reject it outright — but the Alternative Parking Plan requires a Conditional Use permit from the Commission (Section 817.12). Two residents spoke against the project, citing safety and parking concerns, but the Board tabled all motions "to allow developer time to address comments" — not to reconsider the project's scale.

# 📉 The Disconnect Index

⚠️ **The Room vs. The Board:** 2 residents spoke against the 434 Washington Road development (concerns about communication, safety, and parking), but the Planning Board tabled all three motions with *no discussion* of whether the project's density is appropriate for the site. 100% of public speakers opposed the project, yet the Board framed the delay as a technical fix, not a substantive reconsideration.
