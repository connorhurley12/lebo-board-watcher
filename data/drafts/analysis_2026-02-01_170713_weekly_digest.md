# 🏛️ The Deep Dive

### 434 Washington Road: Parking Math Doesn't Add Up for Neighbors

A proposed subdivision at 434 Washington Road remains in limbo after the Planning Board tabled three separate approvals in July. Horizon Properties Group wants to split the 1.9-acre lot into two parcels: one for two multi-family buildings (requiring 96 parking spaces) and another for four 21-foot-wide townhouses. The developer is seeking approval for only 76 spaces through an Alternative Parking Plan, arguing credits for on-street parking and transit access should cover the gap.

**Why you should care:** Two residents showed up to oppose the project. Bill Bannow (460 Washington Road) criticized the lack of communication from developers and argued the design wastes the site's unique features. Tim Rogers (10 Oak Way) raised safety concerns about the proposed road access near his property, citing previous studies that showed the road couldn't safely handle both entrance and exit traffic. The Planning Board agreed the developer needs to address engineering comments on architectural elevations, stormwater management, and parking layouts before moving forward. This is a by-right development in R-7 zoning, meaning if the technical requirements are met, the Commission will have limited grounds to deny it.

### Municipal Trash Collection: The $2 Million Question

The Financial Management Board is deep into a feasibility study on bringing trash collection in-house, and the preliminary numbers aren't promising. Board members broke the analysis into four categories: equipment ($2M for 7 trucks), employee costs ($6.2M annually), disposal fees ($900K annually), and facilities (cost TBD). That's a total operating cost exceeding $6.2 million per year before factoring in property acquisition or lease costs—significantly higher than the current contract at $4-4.5 million annually.

**Why you should care:** Board member Marty Basik noted the municipality would face scale disadvantages that legacy haulers don't have: "One employee call-out or one truck breakdown could shut down the entire operation." The team plans to interview Swiss Vale's DPW director (that municipality recently went in-house) and will report findings to the Commission in Q1 2026. Finance Director Andrew McCreery emphasized the current contract expires in a couple years, so this study is about determining if the concept is "even close" to being feasible. If the numbers don't improve, expect the municipality to stick with contracted service—and likely face higher bids when the contract comes up for renewal.

### Gas Leaf Blowers: From Email to Research Project

The Resiliency Board received an email from Sean Ganoe on Navahoe Drive requesting a ban on gas-powered leaf blowers in Mt. Lebanon. The Sustainability + Local Ecology Committee acknowledged the request needs "further research" to explore impacts on local businesses, residents, and surrounding communities.

**Why you should care:** This is the earliest possible stage of policy consideration—one resident's email that hasn't yet generated formal board discussion. The Resiliency Board also noted a separate request from Lebo Green to ban single-use plastics and Styrofoam, which is further along in the research process. Watch for whether this leaf blower request gains traction with other residents or quietly dies in committee. The board's response was procedural, not enthusiastic.

# 🕵️‍♂️ The Smoke Detector

### Bird Town Pennsylvania Application: Submitted Without Fanfare

The Parks and Recreation Advisory Board quietly confirmed it completed and submitted Mt. Lebanon's application for Bird Town Pennsylvania designation. Board member Natalie Drozda reported the application is done, but no details were provided about what designation would mean for municipal policy, landscaping requirements, or resident obligations. Expect this to resurface if the application is approved and implementation details become public.
