# 🏛️ The Deep Dive

## **$14,500 in 1923 Bought the Land — Now Lincoln Elementary Celebrates a Century**

**The Numbers:** The land for Lincoln Elementary was purchased on November 26, 1923, for $14,500. A $180,000 bond issue passed on March 5, 1924, to fund construction. The school opened in September 1925, making it the second-oldest Mt. Lebanon school still serving students.

**The Hidden Detail:** The first principal, Mrs. Robera McConnell (1925-1932), has a daughter who still substitutes at the high school. This means a direct family connection to the school's founding generation remains active in the district nearly 100 years later.

**The "Next Step" Prediction:** The April 11 celebration (1-4 PM) will draw alumni and current families for building tours, artifact displays, and a time capsule sealing. Expect this event to become a template for future school milestone celebrations — Washington Elementary (the district's oldest building) could be next.

## **86% Open Rate vs. 30% Industry Standard — Parents Actually Read Mt. Lebanon's Emails**

**The Numbers:** The district's parent newsletter has an 86% open rate, compared to the school district standard of ~30% and the general industry standard of 10-15%. Parents spend an average of one minute reading district emails — double the typical 30-second engagement time.

**The Hidden Detail:** The Communications Director manages 125+ requests per year and posts 336 times annually across social media platforms. The website averages 22,000 unique visitors per month, with August being the busiest (back-to-school) and July the quietest. The new website redesign, launching in July 2026, will prioritize ADA compliance ahead of the April 2026 federal deadline for communities over 50,000 (Mt. Lebanon has until spring 2027 but is working early).

**The "Next Step" Prediction:** The July website launch will coincide with the lowest-traffic month, giving the district a buffer before the August rush. Expect the district to lean into visual storytelling (new building photography, updated headshots) and keyword-driven content to maintain its engagement edge. The hidden "New Family Website" (sent only to enrollees via PowerSchool) may be expanded to community partners like real estate agencies and international family groups.

## **Three Administrative Promotions — Two Principals Rose from Substitute and Interim Roles**

**The Numbers:** Dr. Natasha Dera was appointed Assistant Superintendent for Secondary Education on a 5-year contract. Dr. Gina Mahowski was promoted from interim to permanent Principal of Melon Middle School (effective February 17, 2026). Mr. Dan Ridge was promoted from substitute to Principal of Markham Elementary (also effective February 17, 2026). All three appointments passed unanimously.

**The Hidden Detail:** Ridge's promotion from substitute to principal is unusual — most principals follow a traditional assistant principal → interim → permanent path. Mahowski's move from interim to permanent suggests the board wanted continuity at Melon after a leadership transition. Dera's 5-year contract for a central office role is longer than typical 3-year administrative contracts, signaling the board's confidence in her long-term vision for secondary education.

**The "Next Step" Prediction:** Ridge's unconventional path from substitute to principal may open the door for more internal promotions from non-traditional roles. Expect the district to emphasize "homegrown talent" in future hiring narratives, especially as the board continues to prioritize institutional knowledge over external hires.

# 🗣️ Quote of the Week

# 🕵️‍♂️ The Smoke Detector

⚠️ **The Unconventional Promotion:** Mr. Dan Ridge was promoted from substitute teacher to Principal of Markham Elementary — skipping the traditional assistant principal and interim steps. While the board praised his qualifications, this path is highly unusual and may raise questions about whether other internal candidates were considered. The board offered no public explanation for why Ridge was chosen over candidates with more traditional administrative experience.

⚠️ **The Website Redesign Timeline:** The new district website launches in July 2026 — the lowest-traffic month — to avoid disrupting the August back-to-school rush. However, the district is racing to meet ADA compliance standards by April 2026 (the federal deadline for communities over 50,000). Mt. Lebanon technically has until spring 2027 (under 50,000 population), but the tight timeline suggests the district may be responding to a specific complaint or legal concern that wasn't disclosed publicly.

⚠️ **The Hidden "New Family Website":** The district launched a separate onboarding website for new families, but it's hidden from the public and only sent to enrollees via PowerSchool. The Communications Director recommended sharing the link with "community partners" like real estate agencies and international family groups — but didn't explain why the site isn't publicly accessible. If the content is valuable for new families, why isn't it visible to prospective families researching the district?
